  "body": "# Who am I?\r\nI am a 14 year old who likes to play many games, like Clash Royale, Bloons, and other games that I can't remember. This is my website where I go in depth to tell you about my gaming life.\r\n\r\nTwitter: \r\nYoutube (But I don't upload anymore):\r\nFacebook (I don't reply often xP): \r\n\r\n## Clash Royale\r\n![SuperCell's Clash Royale](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6aQ67jk58I/maxresdefault.jpg)\r\nAs of right now, I am level 6 in Arena 4 with about 1100 trophies. My battle deck consists of many different cards, but I like to have an average elixir usage that is below 5. Right now my clan is Sad Story, with 4700 trophies, though they are based in India, so it is hard to communicate. The clan is subject to change ;)\r\n### My battle deck:\r\n- Pekka\r\n- Prince\r\n- Arrows\r\n- Spear Goblins\r\n- Goblins\r\n- Cannon\r\n- Minions\r\n- Something else that I can't remember...\r\n\r\nCome find me.

I play all of the Bloons games, ranging from BMC to BTD5.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
